            <p>I started my journey in the world of computers from an young age,
            now Iâ€™m 30 years old, Pursuing my Web Developer Degree in
            Wake Technical Community College.  Web development is my center of interest, I always
            love the idea of full-stack development, 1-n one code base deploy into almost
            any platform, which web technology like Javascript enables me to do. I also like
            creating Interactive UI components for better UX  and share those desgin and codes
            to the world through Github.
